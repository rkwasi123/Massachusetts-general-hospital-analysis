## 1. Introduction  
This project analyzes synthetic patient and hospital encounter records from Massachusetts General Hospital (2011â€“2022). The goal is to provide actionable insights to improve hospital operations, reduce costs, and enhance patient outcomes.  

---

## 2. Project Description  
The project covers:  
- Data cleaning and transformation in SQL  
- Analytical queries to answer defined business questions  
- Building dashboards in Power BI to communicate insights  
- Recommendations for stakeholders  

---

## 3. Project Aim  
To identify encounter trends, cost drivers, and patient behaviors that impact hospital resource utilization and care quality.  

---

## 4. About the Dataset  
- **Source:** Synthetic dataset (Massachusetts General Hospital)  
- **Records:** ~27,891 encounters, 974 patients  
- **Key Tables:** Patients, Encounters, Payers, Procedures, Dictionary  
- **Fields:** Demographics, encounter class, costs, insurance coverage, procedure codes  

---

## 5. Tools Used  
- Microsoft Excel (exploration)  
- SQL (MySQL â€“ data cleaning & analysis)  
- Power BI (dashboards & storytelling)  

---

## 6. Importing the Dataset  
- CSVs loaded into MySQL staging tables  
- Cleaned and standardized in SQL  
- Imported curated tables into Power BI for dashboarding  

---

## 7. Data Cleaning & Transformation  
- Removed duplicates and empty rows  
- Standardized gender, marital status, and encounter class  
- Converted text-based dates into proper datetime formats  
- Fixed inconsistent procedure codes  
- Removed unnecessary staging fields  

---

## 8. Data Modeling  
- Built a star schema in Power BI:  
  - **Fact table:** Encounters  
  - **Dimensions:** Patients, Payers, Procedures, DimDate, DimEncounterClass  
- Created DAX measures for KPIs (Encounters YoY%, MoM%, Avg Claim Cost, etc.)  

---

## 9. Data Analysis  
Key metrics analyzed:  
- Encounters by year & class  
- Encounter duration (>24hrs vs â‰¤24hrs)  
- Zero payer coverage cases  
- Procedure frequency and costs  
- Readmissions within 30 days  
- Unique patients per quarter

## ðŸ“ˆ Dashboards & Insights  

### ðŸ”¹ 1. Overview Dashboard  
[![Overview Dashboard](images/Overview%20page.png)](images/Overview%20page.png) 

**Key Insights**  
- 27,891 total encounters, 974 unique patients  
- Ambulatory encounters = **44.95%**, followed by Outpatient (22.59%) and Urgent Care (13.14%)  
- YoY encounters increased by **40.13%**, MoM growth was modest at 1.64%  
- Peak encounters: **2014 (3,885)**; peak patients: **2014 Q1 (269)**, over 300% higher than 2011 Q1 (67)  

---

### ðŸ”¹ 2. Cost & Coverage Insights Dashboard  
[![Cost Dashboard](images/Cost%20Insight.png)](images/Cost%20Insight.png)

**Key Insights**  
- Avg base cost per procedure = **$2,092**  
- Highest avg base cost procedure = **$21,111**  
- No-insurance patients have the **highest avg claim cost** ($4,920); dual-eligible patients the lowest ($1,551)  
- Payer coverage: **48.23%**; Self-pay encounters: **1,460**  
- Coronary artery bypass grafting = most expensive procedure (**$56,169**)  

---

### ðŸ”¹ 3. Patient Behavior Dashboard  
[![Patient Behavior](images/patients_behavior.png)](images/patients_behavior.png) 

**Key Insights**  
- Repeat encounter rate: **28.64%**  
- Readmissions within 30 days: **13,138**  
- Top readmitted patient (Kimberly Collier) accounted for **3.63%** of all encounters  
- Patient volumes peaked in **2014 Q1**; variability observed across years  
- Subset of patients drive disproportionate encounters â†’ opportunity for **targeted care management**  

---

## 11. Key Recommendations  
- Reduce uninsured encounters by introducing financial assistance programs.  
- Target care management for frequent readmission patients.  
- Optimize resources for costly inpatient encounters.  
- Prepare staff/resources for seasonal peaks in patient volume.  

---

## 12. Conclusion  
The dashboards highlight operational and financial challenges. Addressing cost inefficiencies and focusing on high-risk patients can improve hospital performance and patient care outcomes.
